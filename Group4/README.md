## Workflow

:chestnut: In a nutshell:

- Create an issue for each open task, make use of the template below
- Look into the [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/fmi08icds/projects/4) to see which tasks are unassinged and in status *Todo*
- Grab a task that you are able to accomplish, assign it to yourself and change the status to *Work in progress*
- Create your own branch and push your commits to it
- When you are done, create a Pull Request to merge your work into the main branch of the group
- Group leader reviews your Pull Request and merges it
- Change the status of your task to *Done* if the Pull Request has been successfully merged
- Repeat until all tasks are done

### Branches and Pull Requests

The main branch of this group is called `group-4`. It is a protected branch such that no commits can be pushed to it directly. Instead a [Pull Request](https://github.com/fmi08icds/Groupwork/pulls) must be created and approved by the group leader, to merge a feature branch into the `group-4` branch. Besides that, there are no restrictions when creating feature branches. Make sure that everything is safe before creating the Pull Request.

### Issues

All work packages (tasks) are described as [Issues](https://github.com/fmi08icds/Groupwork/issues). When writing an Issue please consider the following:

- Make sure that the workload is not too big. As a rule of thumb, a single person should be able to complete it in less than a week
- Provide a short description of what needs to be done
- Provide a list of Acceptance Criteria. These are requirements that need to be met to call the task done
- Assign the Issue to the project "Group 4 - Clustering" and set the status to "Todo"
- Do not assign the issue to anyone unless it is already known who is responsible for the task

Here is a template with an example content:

<summary>Markdown Template for Issues</summary>

``` md
**Description:**

Currently, our dataset mostly contains pictures of cats with dark fur.
I observed that the classification accuracy suffers from this bias.
We should add more samples to the dataset that show cats with different colored fur.

**Acceptance criteria**:

- 1000 samples were added to the dataset
- It was assured that these new samples show cats with bright colored fur
- The new samples are considered when creating the train/test split and executing `train.py`
```

### Projects

Issues are organized in a [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/fmi08icds/projects/4). The board consists of three columns that represent the statuses *Todo*, *Work in progress* and *Done*. The status can be changed by simply dragging the cards into another column.

If you want to work on a task, look for unassigned issues in the *Todo* column. Read the description and acceptance criteria of the issue. If you feel like you are able to work on this task, assign it to yourself and change the status to *Work in progress*. In case the goal of the task is unclear, ask the creator of the issue for clarification. Once you have completed the task, congratulations, you can change the status to *Done* :+1:
